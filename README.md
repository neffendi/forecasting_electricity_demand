# The Increase in Electricity Demand caused by Tourist Electric Vehicles in the Niagara Region of Ontario

The expected rapid growth of electric vehicles (EV) over the next few decades is expected to increase global electricity demand and may cause a strain on electrical grids. This issue presents a unique challenge for holiday destinations primarily accessed by car due to increased tourist EV charging. This project aims to forecast the increase in electricity demand factoring in tourist EV charging in the Niagara region of Ontario in 2030 and 2040 compared to electricity demand from 2016-2020. A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model was used to predict the base electricity demand (BED) for short term predictions and a Seasonal OLS model was used for 2030 and 2040 predictions, and the projected electricity demand from tourist EV charging was calculated using tourist data and expected EV market penetration in Canada.
